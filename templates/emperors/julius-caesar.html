<p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>His cognomen, Caesar, was taken by later emperors as a title and was an inspiration for the modern Kaiser and Tsar.</li>
<li>Although traditionally his last words are throught to be, &quot;You too, Brutus&quot;, popularised by William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, it is more likely he either said nothing at all, or said &quot;Kai su, teknon?&quot; which translates from (Ancient?) Greek to &quot;You too, child?&quot;</li>
