<p>The Praetorian Guard likely knew they were going to need a successor to Caligula, and his uncle Claudius was a good enough choice. Although he wasn't as cruel a man as Caligula, he also disliked the Senators, and liked to take advice from his freedmen. In 43AD he commanded a very successful invasion of Britain, boosting his popularity immensely. He also commisioned the port named &quot;<code>portus</code>&quot; at the mouth of the River Tiber, which could handle year round shipments of grain, needed to make bread, a staple of the Roman diet.
In the late 40's it was discovered by Claudius that his young wife had been cheating on him <em>extensively</em>, even going so far as to have a mock wedding with one of her lovers. This is not to say Claudius did not also have lovers, but it was alright for him, because he was the Emperor. He had his wife and several of her lovers executed in 48AD[]. After executing his young wife and her lovers, he married his niece. The law plainly <em>didn't</em> alow this, so he made sure to change it. His niece, that, conicedently, was the same one that Tiberius had exiled to an island with her sons. Well, she made sure to bring her son Nero into the public light, and when she realised that Claudius' son Britannicus couldn't rule until next year (55AD), she had Claudius' mushrooms poisoned, leaving her son Nero to rule the Roman Empire. Claudius lived for 63 years, and ruled the empire for approximately 13 years.</p>
