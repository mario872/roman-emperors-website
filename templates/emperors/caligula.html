<h4>GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS GERMANICUS</h4>
<p>While Tiberius had been moderately tyrannical, at least he had been capable, and qualified. Caligula started his reign well, ending his Great Uncle Tiberius' treason trials but it all went downhill from there. Caligula tried to halt these stories by spreading rumours of Tiberius being a paedophile, but these did not work well.
Caligula began to suggest to others that he was a god, and believed this was a good enough reason to sexually assault women at parties. He also like watching people be tortured.
In an effort to regain the good faith of the people he tried to invade Britain during his short rule, but it turned into pure chaos as his troops were forced to retreat, but commanded to bring back seashells to showcase Caligula's defeat of Neptune the sea god.
Finally, in 41AD, Caligula was assassinated by a member of the Praetorian guard, ending his reign of terror. (Don't worry though, there'll be a sequel with Nero.)</p>
