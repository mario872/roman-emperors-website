<h4>TIBERIUS JULIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS</h4>
<p>Tiberius already had a strong grip of rule over most of the Empire even before Augustus' death, and it became even tighter afterwards. Shortly after his ascension to the position, 7 legions staged mutinies because they were not being allowed to retire, being treated badly, and being underpaid, but these were swiftly dealt with by Tiberius' son Drusus and newly appointed command of the Praetorian Guard, Aelius Sejanus. Tiberius started undertaking a tyrannical rule, repeatedly invoking the lex maiestatis, (which was basically) accusing people of high treason, and if they were found guilty, he got a share of their land. In 19AD, Tiberius' nephew and heir apparent died, and rumours flew he was poisoned by the Governor of Syria. Shortly after a visit to the governor of Syria by Sejanus however, the governor &quot;committed suicide and <em>slit his own throat</em>&quot;. In 23AD, Drusus too, died, and it turned out to be a plot by Sejanus. Possibly from 19AD, he had been in an affair with Drusus' wife, and he supposed that if he made himself essential to the Emperor, he would be appointed successor. Marrying Drusus' widow, would cement his position close to Tiberius, but Tiberius forbade this, although he did begin to put <em>more</em> trust in him from that point onward. In 28AD, Tiberius retired and handed running of the Empire over to Sejanus, and only a year later banished Germanicus' wife and children to an island because they were continuously and repeatedly blaming him for Germanicus' death.
In 31AD Sejanus hatched a plan to keep his power by killing Tiberius and his remaining male family, but the mother of Germanicus sent a slave girl to warn Tiberius. The Senate had Sejanus strangled and his body thrown to a violent mob.</p>
