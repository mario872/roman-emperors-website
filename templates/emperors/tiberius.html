<h4><em>TIBERIUS JULIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS</em></h4>
<h2>IN BREVI</h2>
<h4><em>In Short</em></h4>
<p>Tiberius was an emperor that created and cultivated a climate of fear in his empire. Throughout his reign he charged anyone that criticised him with treason and sent them to prison, or death. He spent his final years in a villa on an island, brooding and governing his empire from there.</p>
<h2>VITA ET FAMILIA<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></h2>
<h4><em>Life and Family</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>DIES NATALIS: 6th November, 42BC</li>
<li>PATER: Tiberius Nero</li>
<li>MATER: Livia Drusilla</li>
<li>LIBERI: Julius Caesar Drusus (by Vispania Agrippina) &amp; adopted Germanicus (at command of Emperor Augustus)</li>
<li>DIES MORTIS: 16th March, 37AD</li>
</ul>
<h2>LUDIBUNDA VERA</h2>
<h4><em>Fun Facts</em></h4>
<p>Tiberius really loved cucumbers, so much so that he had garden beds with wheels constructed so that he would never be unable to eat them.</p>
<p>&quot;<code>Cartilaginum generis extraque terram est cucumis, mira voluptate Tiberio principi expetitus. nullo quippe non die contigit ei, pensiles eorum hortos promoventibus in solem rotis olitoribus rursusque hibernis diebus intra specularium munimenta revocantibus.</code>&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Which translates to &quot;The cucumber belongs to the cartilaginous class of plants, and grows above the ground. It was a wonderful favourite with the Emperor Tiberius, and, indeed, he was never without it; for he had raised beds made in frames upon wheels, by means of which the cucumbers were moved and exposed to the full heat of the sun; while, in winter, they were withdrawn, and placed under the protection of frames glazed with mirror-stone.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2>IN LONGUM</h2>
<h4><em>In Long</em></h4>
<p>Tiberius already had a strong grip of rule over most of the Empire even before Augustus' death, and it became even tighter afterwards. Shortly after his ascension to the Emperor, 7 legions staged mutinies because they were not being allowed to retire, being treated badly, and being underpaid<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>, but these were swiftly dealt with by Tiberius' son Drusus and newly appointed command of the Praetorian Guard, Aelius Sejanus. Tiberius started undertaking a tyrannical rule, repeatedly invoking the <code>lex maiestatis</code>, (which was accusing people of high treason, but expanded by Tiberius to nearly any insult to him<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>), and if they were found guilty, he got a share of their land. In 19AD, Tiberius' nephew and heir apparent died, and rumours flew he was poisoned by the Governor of Syria. Shortly after a visit to the governor of Syria by Sejanus (A prefect of the Paretorian Guard) however, the governor &quot;committed suicide and <em>slit his own throat</em>&quot;. In 23AD, Drusus too, died, and it turned out to be a plot by Sejanus<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>. Possibly from 19AD, he had been in an affair with Drusus' wife, and he supposed that if he made himself essential to the Emperor, he would be appointed successor. Marrying Drusus' widow, would cement his position close to Tiberius, but Tiberius forbade this, although he did begin to put <em>more</em> trust in him from that point onward. In 28AD, Tiberius retired and handed running of the Empire over to Sejanus, and only a year later banished Germanicus' wife and children to an island because they were continuously and repeatedly blaming him for Germanicus' death.
In 31AD Sejanus hatched a plan to keep his power by killing Tiberius and his remaining male family, but the mother of Germanicus sent a slave girl to warn Tiberius. The Senate had Sejanus strangled and his body thrown to a violent mob.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>
Tiberius' final years were spent at Capri, an island off the coast of Italy, on which Augustus had developed a villa and died there. Tiberius spend his time brooding, and as the years passed, grew less and less confident that Caligula, his adopted grandson would be a good emperor. But he spent his time looking to the stars, and discovered that Caligula's ascension could not be halted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> Tiberius died in 37AD, of natural cause, although there are stories that he was smothered by Caligula, or the (new) prefect of the Paretorian Guard<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
