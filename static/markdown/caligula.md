# **Caligula**
#### *GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS GERMANICUS*

## IN BREVI
#### *In Short*
Caligula, although initially popular with the people, was ultimately an insane man who did many mad things in his time. He freed the prisoners who Tiberius had imprisoned on accusations of treason, and removed some unpopular taxes. But he also proclaimed himself a god, made his own temple and undertook a disastrous invasion of Britain. Upon his retreat, he commanded his soldiers to collect seashells to showcase their defeat of Neptune the sea god. Finally in 41AD, he was assassinated by a member of the praetorian guard, and his reign of terror ended.

 - • He said he wanted to make his favorite horse a consul.
   - "`Incitato equo, cuius causa pridie circenses, ne inquietaretur, viciniae silentium per milites indicere solebat, praeter equile marmoreum et praesaepe eburneum praeterque purpurea tegumenta ac monilia e gemmis domum etiam et familiam et supellectilem dedit, quo lautius nomine eius invitati acciperentur; consulatum quoque traditur destinasse.`"[^2]
   - Which translates to: "He used to send his soldiers on the day before the games and order silence in the neighbourhood, to prevent the horse Incitatus⁠101 from being disturbed. Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, he even gave this horse a house, a troop of slaves and furniture, for the more elegant entertainment of the guests invited in his name; and it is also said that he planned to make him consul."[^3]
 - • When there wasn't enough cattle to feed the beasts for his gladiatorial shows, he fed them human prisoners instead.[^4]
 - • He made a bridge over Baiae's bay and rode across it for two days, going back and forth. This was possibly to try and rival Xerxes, or because an astrologer had told Tiberius that Caligula had as much chance at being emperor as riding over the bay.[^5]

## IN LONGUM
#### *In Long*
While Tiberius had been moderately tyrannical, at least he had been capable and qualified. Caligula started his reign well, ending his Great Uncle Tiberius' treason trials, freeing many of Tiberius' prisoners[^6], and getting rid of some unpopular taxes[^7], but it all went downhill from there.
Caligula began to suggest to others that he was a god, and believed this was a good enough reason to sexually assault women at parties. He also had a temple dedicated to himself built, staffed with its own priests and spectacular animals to sacrifice to him. He even had a life sized statue of himself made in gold[^8], and had it dressed in "clothing such as he wore himself."[^9] He had animals such as "flamingoes, peacocks, black grouse [(a bird)], guinea hens, and pheasants"[^10] sacrificed to him regularly.
He also like watching people be tortured.
In an effort to regain the good faith of the people he tried to invade Britain during his short rule, but it turned into pure chaos as his troops were forced to retreat, but commanded to bring back seashells to showcase Caligula's defeat of Neptune the sea god.
A soothsayer warned him to be wary of a man named Cassius[^11], so he had the Proconsul of Asia (named Cassius Longinus) assassinated[^12]. But he failed to remember that there was a member of the Praetorian Guard named Cassius Chaerea as well.
Finally, in 41AD, Caligula was assassinated by Cassius Chaerea, among other conspirators, ending his reign of terror. (Don't worry though, there'll be a sequel with Nero.)
