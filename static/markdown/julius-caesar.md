**Facts:**
- His cognomen, Caesar, was taken by later emperors as a title and was an inspiration for the modern Kaiser and Tsar.
- Although traditionally his last words are throught to be, "You too, Brutus", popularised by William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, it is more likely he either said nothing at all, or said "Kai su, teknon?" which translates from (Ancient?) Greek to "You too, child?"
