# **Augstus Caesar**
#### *GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR OCTAVIANUS*

## IN BREVI
#### *In Short*
Octavian (later Augustus Caesar) formed the Second Triumvirate with Mark Antony (Julius Caesar's consul partner) and Aemilius Lepidus in 43BC, in response to their respective claims to the dictatorship, as Octavian had been named Julius Caesar's adopted son and chief heir in his will. One of their first acts as rulers of Rome was to kill 300 members of the upper class to create a climate of fear, so that their soldiers wouldn't ask to be paid. Octavian and Mark Antony then spent some time fighting the chief assassins of Julius Caesar's armies, and they eventually won in 36BC. Shortly after, Octavian stripped Lepidus of his powers, and then at the end of 33BC (when the Triumvirate's agreement expired) Octavian declared himself the only head of state and the Senate granted him the powers to go to war with Antony. After a crushing defeat Antony committed suicide and Octavian was left as Rome's sole leader. In 28BC he dutifully renounced his dictatorship, but continued as dictator of Rome in all but name with the extra powers given to him by the Senate. He then had the name Augustus given to him later in life by the Senate, and died in 14AD, after giving his stepson Tiberius most of his powers already.

## IN LONGUM
#### *In Long*
Octavian (Octavianus in Latin, or Augustus Caesar late in life) was only 19 when his Uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated, and he was adopted by Julius in his will[^4]. Shortly after this, Mark Antony, Julius Caesar's partner in his 5th consulship, called Julius' assassination a murder by conspiracy and the chief conspirators were very quickly driven out of Rome. During the power vacuum that occurred after that, the Second Triumvirate was formed between Octavian, Mark Antony, and Aemilius Lepidus (deputy to Julius Caesar). They then made put this partnership into law in 43BC[^5], effectively naming themselves dictators, and it was the beginning of the end for the Republic of Rome.

Their first noble decision as dictators of Rome, was to instill fear into their people by killing over 300 members of the upper class[^6], including Cicero, a political opponent of Antony. They created this climate of fear, because they simply didn't have enough money to pay their troops, and hoped they would be too terrified to ask. In 42BC Antony fought with his and Octavian's troops against Brutus and Cassius (two of Julius Caesar's assassins) and their troops while Octavius stayed in his tent too sick to fight.[^7] They won this battle, and continued to fight against the assassins' supporters, repeatedly renewing the triumvirate. In 36BC Octavian defeated Sextus Pompey, stripped Lepidus of his powers and made him retire[^8]. While Antony (who was married to Octavian's sister[^9]) was busying partying with Cleopatra in Alexandria, Octavian passed many laws to make Rome a better place. These included making sure people had enough to eat, and not settling his retired soldiers on other Italians' land.[^10]

The legal authority of the triumviri expired at the end of 33BC and shortly after Octavian marched into the Senate with an armed guard, proclaimed that he was now the only head of state, and was granted more powers by the Senate to go to war against Antony and Cleopatra[^11]. Antony and Cleopatra, after seeing their naval forces were stuck in the Bay of Actium (off the East Coast of Greece) narrowly escaped capture themselves, until a year later when Octavian invaded Alexandria. Antony committed suicide in Cleopatra's arms, and shortly after she used a venomous snake to kill herself.[^12]

When Octavius returned to Rome in 28BC, he (surprisingly) renounced his dictatorship, but the Senate urged him to keep guiding Rome in her decisions, and bestowed the name Augustus (meaning revered personage) on him.[^13] Wanting to avoid micromanaging Rome like Julius Caesar and appearing a dictator, Augustus went to war with some rowdy Spanish tribes. After two years he gained enough ground to claim victory, but it took another 15 years to fully bring the Spanish province under Roman control.[^14] In 23BC he gave up his consulship halfway through the year because he was life threateningly sick, but was granted more legal powers by the Senate which gave him control over Rome's provinces and over Rome itself. At the end of 23BC the Senate offered Augustus the dictatorship to aid him in ending the grain shortage, but he refused it in order to keep up the appearance that Rome was still a republic to the people.[^15]

In 18BC Augustus introduced legislation to promote men with 3 or more children in politics, and anyone who refused to marry could be cut off from their inheritance. Additionally, he forced husbands to divorce their wife if she cheated on him.[^16]

Augustus did more before his death, but the most interesting/funny/concerning thing he did is described in Augustus' chapter of the The Twelve Caesars, after hearing his legions were crushingly defeated in Germania:

`Adeo denique consternatum ferunt, ut per continuos menses barba capilloque summisso caput interdum foribus illideret vociferans: "Quintili Vare, legiones redde!`[^17]

Which translates to: "In fact, they say that he was so greatly affected that for several months in succession he cut neither his beard nor his hair, and sometimes he would dash his head against a door, crying: "Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!"[^18]

By his death is 14AD he had already given his stepson Tiberius the power to rule over the entirety of the empire apart from Rome, and upon his death, those powers passed to him too.[^19]
