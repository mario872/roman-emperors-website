# **Tiberius**
#### *TIBERIUS JULIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS*

## IN BREVI
#### *In Short*
Tiberius was an emperor who created and cultivated a climate of fear in his empire. Throughout his reign he charged anyone who criticised him with treason and sent them to prison, or had them killed. He spent his final years in a villa on an island named Capri, brooding and governing his empire from there.

## LUDIBUNDA VERA
#### *Fun Facts*
Tiberius really loved cucumbers, so much so that he had garden beds with wheels constructed so that he would never be unable to eat them.

"`Cartilaginum generis extraque terram est cucumis, mira voluptate Tiberio principi expetitus. nullo quippe non die contigit ei, pensiles eorum hortos promoventibus in solem rotis olitoribus rursusque hibernis diebus intra specularium munimenta revocantibus.`"[^2]

Which translates to "The cucumber belongs to the cartilaginous class of plants, and grows above the ground. It was a wonderful favourite with the Emperor Tiberius, and, indeed, he was never without it; for he had raised beds made in frames upon wheels, by means of which the cucumbers were moved and exposed to the full heat of the sun; while, in winter, they were withdrawn, and placed under the protection of frames glazed with mirror-stone."[^3]

## IN LONGUM
#### *In Long*
Tiberius already had a strong grip of rule over most of the Empire before Augustus' death, and it became even tighter afterwards. Shortly after his ascension to the position of Emperor, 7 legions staged mutinies because they were not being allowed to retire, being treated badly, and being underpaid[^4], but these were swiftly dealt with by Tiberius' son Drusus and newly appointed command of the Praetorian Guard, Aelius Sejanus. Tiberius started a tyrannical rule, repeatedly invoking the `lex maiestatis`, (which was accusing people of high treason, but expanded by Tiberius to nearly any insult to him[^5]), and if they were found guilty, he got a share of their land. In 19AD, Tiberius' nephew and heir appare
nt, named Germanicus, died, and rumours flew he was poisoned by the Governor of Syria. Shortly after a visit to the governor of Syria by Sejanus (A prefect of the Praetorian Guard) however, the governor "committed suicide and *slit his own throat*"[^6]. In 23AD, Drusus died as well, and it turned out to be a plot by Sejanus[^7]. It is possible that from as far back as 19AD, he had been in an affair with Drusus' wife, and he supposed that if he made himself essential to the Emperor, he would be appointed successor. Marrying Drusus' widow would cement his position close to Tiberius; however, Tiberius forbade this, although he did begin to put *more* trust in him from that point onward. In 28AD, Tiberius retired and handed running of the Empire over to Sejanus. 
Only a year later he banished Germanicus' wife and children to an island because they were continuously and repeatedly blaming him for Germanicus' death.
In 31AD Sejanus hatched a plan to keep his power by killing Tiberius and his remaining male family, but Germanicus' mother sent a slave girl to warn Tiberius. The Senate had Sejanus strangled and his body thrown to a violent mob.[^8]
Tiberius' final years were spent at Capri (an island off the coast of Italy where Augustus had developed a villa) and died there. Tiberius spend his time brooding, and as the years passed, grew less and less confident that Caligula, his adopted grandson would be a good emperor. But he spent his time looking to the stars, and discovered that Caligula's ascension could not be halted.[^9] Tiberius died in 37AD, of natural causes, although there are stories that he was smothered by Caligula, or the (new) prefect of the Praetorian Guard[^10].
