# **CLAUDIUS**
#### *TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS GERMANICUS*

## IN BREVI
#### *In Short*
Claudius' physical disfigurements and self-exaggerated simple-mindedness allowed him to make it to adulthood without being seen as a threat by people in power. He liked to take advice from his freedmen and let them rule over vast areas of the Empire, allowing him to rule at a much higher level. He invaded Britain to great success, but also had many wives who were not faithful or loving toward him. One may have tried to take over the empire, and the other killed him to allow her son, Nero to rule the empire.

## LUDIBUNDA VERA
#### *Fun Facts*
 - • He wrote books on the history of the Etruscans and the Carthaginians
 - "`Denique et Graecas scripsit historias, Tyrrhenicon viginti, Carchedoniacon octo. Quarum causa veteri Alexandriae Musio additum ex ipsius nomine novum;⁠ institutumque ut quotannis in altero Tyrrhenicon libri, in altero Carchedoniacon diebus statutis velut in auditorio recitarentur toti a singulis per vicies.`"[^2]
 - Which translates to: "At last he even wrote historical works in Greek, twenty books of Etruscan History and eight of Carthaginian. Because of these works there was added to the old Museum at Alexandria a new one called after his name, and it was provided that in the one his Etruscan History should be read each year from beginning to end, and in the other his Carthaginian, by various readers in turn, in the manner of public recitations."[^3]

## IN LONGUM
#### *In Long*
The Praetorian Guard likely knew they were going to need a successor to Caligula, and his uncle Claudius was a good enough choice. Claudius was physically disfigured with a club foot, and possibly cerebral palsy. He learned to exaggerate both these and his simple-mindedness so that he didn't appear a threat to anyone in power, and in so avoid his assassination. Although he wasn't as cruel a man as Caligula, he also disliked the Senators, and liked to take advice from his freedmen. He let his freedmen handle the running of most of the immense empire[^4], as it allowed him to rule from a higher level. In 43AD he commanded a very successful invasion of Britain, boosting his popularity immensely. He also commissioned the port named "`Portus`" at the mouth of the River Tiber, which could handle year-round shipments of grain, needed to make bread, a staple of the Roman diet.

In the late 40's it was discovered by Claudius that his young wife had been cheating on him *extensively*, even going so far as to marry one of her lovers[^5]. This is not to say Claudius did not also have lovers, but it was alright for him, because he was the Emperor. It's possible that his wife and her lover were planning to take over Rome and get rid of Claudius, or something else entirely. Either way, Claudius had his wife and several of her lovers executed in 48AD[^6]. After executing his young wife and her lovers, he married his niece. The law plainly *didn't* alow this, so he made sure to change it.[^7] His niece, that, coincidentally, was the same one that Tiberius had exiled to an island with her sons. Well, she made sure to bring her son Nero into the public light, and when she realised that Claudius' heir Britannicus couldn't rule until next year (55AD), she (or possibly someone else) had Claudius' mushrooms poisoned[^8], leaving her son Nero to rule the Roman Empire. Claudius died in 54AD, having lived for 63 years, and ruled the empire for approximately 13 years.
